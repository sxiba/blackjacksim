# Blackjack Simulator Galore 

A simple blackjack sim made in `Python3`. 
Development took a turn with figuring out the `split` feature, which was addressed by iterating through each hand if the player so chooses to split.
Payout is 3:2 for natural blackjack, 1:1 otherwise.

## How to install & run 
Requirements: `python3`.

Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/sxiba/blackjacksim`

Run with `python3 main.py`.
