# Blackjack Simulator Galore 

A simple blackjack sim made in `Python3` from watching a lot of content online to refresh programming skills. Payout is 3:2 for a natural blackjack, with a 1:1 payout otherwise. 

## Challenges 
Development took a turn with figuring out the `split` feature, which was addressed by iterating through each hand if the player so chooses to split.

## How to install & run 
Requirements: `python3`.

Clone repo: `git clone https://github.com/sxiba/blackjacksim`

Run with `python3 main.py`.
